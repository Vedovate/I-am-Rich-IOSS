# I Am Rick App for iOS

## Overview

I Am Rick is a simple app for iOS that I'm developing as a way to study iOS development. The app features a picture of Rick Sanchez from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty," along with a button that plays a catchphrase from the character.

## Installation

The app is currently in development and not yet available on the App Store. However, you can install it on your iOS device by cloning the repository and building the app in Xcode.

## Usage

Once the app is installed on your iOS device, simply launch it and press the button to hear Rick's catchphrase.

## Contributing

As this is a personal project for learning purposes, I am not currently accepting contributions from others. However, feel free to fork the repository and make your own changes.
